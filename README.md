# Glacier Guard 
  (AI Powered System for Glacier   Monitoring and Future Prediction)  


 

---

## üöÄ Introduction

- The Glacier Guard project uses satellite imagery and deep learning to monitor and predict glacier changes. It detects glacier retreat, forecasts future behavior, and provides visual insights for decision-making.
- Badswat Glacier is being used as a test case, with plans to extend the coverage to all glaciers in Gilgit in the upcoming years.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem:

- Climate change accelerates glacial melting, leading to GLOFs, water scarcity, and threats to food security. These challenges disrupt livelihoods, force human migration, and demand urgent solutions to mitigate risks and ensure sustainability.


## Objectives:

- To monitor accelerated glacier retreat and provide early warnings for GLOFs, while offering climate change insights and addressing socio-economic impacts.
- To integrate advanced machine learning models with cloud-based solutions for accurate prediction of glacial lake outbursts and their socio-economic impacts. 


## Tools Used:
- Data Collection: Earth Explorer (USGS)
- Data Labelling: Roboflow
- Machine Learning: ML algorithms, NLP, Deep Learning
- Temporary GUI: Gradio (Python Library)
